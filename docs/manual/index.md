# Housing Insights & Risk Forecasting â€” Methods and Models

*A Comprehensive Guide to Econometric, Machine Learning, and Risk Approaches*

---

## Preface

This manual is designed as both a **personal reference** and a **resource for others** (such as MIT Emerging Talent students, panel judges, or researchers) 
who want to understand the methods behind housing forecasting.  

It brings together **econometric models**, **machine learning methods**, and **risk analysis techniques**, and shows how they are integrated into a working 
**Housing Insights & Risk Dashboard**.
